##Getting and cleaning data Read Me

To generate the 'tidydataset.txt' follow these steps
1. execute the 'run_analysis.R' script to create the necessary set of functions
2. Run the 'createdatafile' function; if your working directory contains the "UCI HAR Dataset" directory then there is no need to supply an argument, alternatively provide the path to the dataset (relative to your current working directory)
